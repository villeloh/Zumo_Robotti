    The method Measure_Voltage() was used during development to measure the robot's battery voltage level -- once at robot start and then every 80 seconds 
    (or thereabouts) while the robot was on. The logic was deleted from main.c in order not to interfere with the race and sumo contest; however, it is  
    included here for review.<br>
